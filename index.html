                    Alfred's father owned a factory in Russia, but after the Crimean Wars he went bankrupt. Alfred began

                    Alfred moved to the United States and continued his work with nitroglycerin. He discovered that it
                    became safer with added elements, and the result was dynamite.</li>
                <li><strong>1867 </strong>Dynamite was patented
